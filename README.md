Wouldn’t it be cool if you could just wave a pen in the air to draw something virtually and it actually draws it on the screen? It could be even more interesting if we didn’t use any special hardware to actually achieve this, just plain simple computer vision would do, in fact, we wouldn’t even need to use machine learning or deep learning to achieve this.
